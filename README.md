#Â How to Run

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Assets (/public)

As the name says, it contains assets of our project like images, styles, fonts, ...

### Components

Components are the building blocks of any react project. This folder consists of a collection of UI components like buttons, modals, inputs, etc., that can be used across various files in the project. Each component should consist of a test file to do a unit test as it will be widely used in the project.

### Layouts

This is just a special folder for placing any layout based components. This would be things like a sidebar, navbar, container, etc.
### Utils

#### Context

The context folder stores all your React context files that are used across multiple pages. I find on larger projects you will have multiple context you use across your application and having a single folder to store them is really useful.

#### Helpers

It contains the reusable helper functions.

#### Hooks

The hooks folder contains every single custom hook in your entire project. This is a useful folder to have in any size project since almost every project will have multiple custom hooks so having a single place to put them all is really useful.

### Pages

The files in the pages folder indicate the route of the React application. Each file in this folder contains its route. A page can contain its subfolder. Each page has its state and is usually used to call an async operation. It usually consists of various components grouped.

### Services

It contains the http request function using axios or ...

### Redux

A place to store Redux files.
